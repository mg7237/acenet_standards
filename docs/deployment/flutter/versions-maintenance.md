!> Don't **abuse** the **maintenance** feature. It is very important that we handle all platforms without affecting live users.

1. Individual **User Platforms** can be put **In** and **Out** of **Maintenance Mode** as per the requirements.
1. In Addition, **Specific Versions** of Individual User Platforms can also be put in Maintenance Mode.
1. Reasons of putting Platforms in Maintenance can be as following :
    - Putting Updates with Breaking Changes in the Applications.
    - Maintenance of Servers or Infrastructures are going on.
    - Some critical bugs are found and we want to prevent users from accessing the applications.
    - We want to prevent users from accessing the platform for any other reasons.
    - A singe Version has some ritical bug and we want to prevent users from using that version only.
